# belly-button-challenge
This challenge involves building an interactive dashboard to explore microbial biodiversity in human navels using the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. Here we use D3.js to load data, create visualizations like bar and bubble charts, and display demographic metadata. The dashboard will allow users to select samples dynamically, updating the plots accordingly. Finally, you'll deploy the app to a static hosting service, ensuring proper documentation and version control. This project strengthens skills in data visualization, web development, and interactive design for scientific analysis.

### Workflow description:
Use the D3 library\
Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in selected individual\
Create a bubble chart that displays each sample\
Display the sample's metadata\
Update all the plots when a new sample is selected
